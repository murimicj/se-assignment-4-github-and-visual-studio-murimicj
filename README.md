Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.

GitHub is a web based platform used for version control and collaboration in software development, allowing developers to store,track, and share their code and work together on projects.

Primary functions and features:
Version control- tracks changes made to code overtime, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
Collaboration- enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously,tracktheir changes, and merge them together.
Issue tracking- allows teams to report and track bugs,feature requests,and other issues related to the project.
Project management- provides tools for planning,tracking and managing software development projects.

How it supports collaborative software development
Forking and pull requests- developers can create their own copies of a repository,make changes, and submit pull request to have their changes merged back into the original repository.

Repositories on GitHub:

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
GitHub repository- this is a central storage location where code,documentation and other files are hosted and managed as part of a software development project.
How to create a new repository
1.Sign in to github via github.com
2.Click the + sign in the top right corner of the page.
3.Select the new repository 
4.Enter a brief namefor the repository,a description plus select if you want it private or public.
